## 🔧 How It Works

AntiCrow acts as a bridge between Discord and Antigravity.

```
📱 Discord (Mobile/PC)
    ↕ Message exchange
🐦‍⬛ AntiCrow Extension (Your PC)
    ↕ Task coordination
🤖 Antigravity AI (Your PC)
```

> 🔒 **All processing runs entirely on your PC.** No data is sent to external servers. Only Discord API communication is performed. No telemetry or usage statistics are collected.

---

## Prerequisites

| Item | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Antigravity | Installed and launchable |
| Node.js | 18.0.0 or higher |
| Discord Account | Developer Portal access required for Bot creation |
| Discord Server | A server where you have admin permissions |

> 💡 For fully autonomous operation, install the companion extension [pesosz/antigravity-auto-accept](https://github.com/pesosz/antigravity-auto-accept), which automatically handles approval buttons (Run / Allow / Continue) in Antigravity.

---

## Setup Guide

### 1️⃣ Create a Discord Bot

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click **"New Application"** in the top right → Enter a name (e.g., `AntiCrow`)
3. Select **"Bot"** from the left menu
4. Click **"Reset Token"** to obtain a token → **Save it immediately** (it cannot be displayed again)
5. On the same page, configure **Privileged Gateway Intents**:
   - ✅ **MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT** — Required (to read message content)
   - ✅ **SERVER MEMBERS INTENT** — Recommended (for user information retrieval)

### 2️⃣ Invite the Bot to Your Server

1. Select **"OAuth2"** from the left menu
2. In **"URL Generator"**, configure:
   - **SCOPES**: `bot`
   - **BOT PERMISSIONS**: `Send Messages`, `Read Message History`, `Add Reactions`, `Manage Channels`, `Manage Messages`, `Attach Files`, `Embed Links`, `Use Slash Commands`, `Create Public Threads`, `Send Messages in Threads`, `Manage Threads`
3. Copy the generated URL and open it in your browser → Invite the Bot to your server

### 3️⃣ Install the Extension

Search for **"AntiCrow"** in the Antigravity extension marketplace and click **Install**.

Or install from the [OpenVSX Marketplace](https://open-vsx.org/extension/lucianlamp/anti-crow).

### 4️⃣ Initial Configuration

1. Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) → Run **"AntiCrow: Set Bot Token"** → Enter the Bot Token you saved
2. When **`✓ AntiCrow`** appears in the status bar, you're connected 🎉

> `autoStart` is enabled by default, so the bridge will start automatically after setting the token.

> ⚠️ **Important:** AntiCrow requires Antigravity to be launched from a dedicated desktop shortcut.
> After initial setup, create a shortcut with the `AntiCrow: Create Desktop Shortcut` command and always launch from it.

---

## Basic Usage

### 💬 Send Natural Language Requests (#agent-chat)

Just send a message in the `#agent-chat` channel. AntiCrow analyzes the content and automatically determines whether to execute immediately or register as a scheduled task.

**Instant Execution:**

```
List all TODOs in the current project
```

```
Fix the bug shown in this image
```

**Scheduled Execution:**

```
Summarize GitHub notifications every morning at 9 AM
```

→ Converted to a cron expression and executed automatically at the specified time.

### ✅ Confirmation Reactions

When confirmation is required before execution:

- Press ✅ → **Approve and start execution**
- Press ❌ → **Reject and cancel**

### 📎 File Attachments

Attach files to your message, and AI will analyze the content and use it for the task. Supports various formats including images, text, and documents.

---

## Workspace Integration

AntiCrow automatically detects open Antigravity workspaces and creates categories in the Discord server.

```
📁 🔧 crypto (Category)
  └── #agent-chat
📁 🔧 web-app (Category)
  └── #agent-chat
```

Messages sent from channels within a category are executed in the corresponding workspace. If the workspace's Antigravity is not running, it will automatically attempt to launch.

---

## 🤖 Continuous Auto Mode

AI autonomously decides the next action and executes tasks in sequence. Start with the `/auto` command:

```
/auto Redesign the landing page
/auto --steps 15 --confirm semi Refactor the entire project
```

**Options:** `--steps N` (1-20), `--duration N` (5-120 min), `--confirm auto|semi|manual`, `--select auto-delegate|first|ai-select`

**Safety Guard:** 21-pattern detection protects against file system destruction, Git force operations, database drops, crypto key leaks, and prompt injection attacks.

---


## 🤝 Agent Team Mode

Multiple AI sub-agents execute tasks in parallel. Large-scale changes are automatically split, with multiple AIs working simultaneously.

- 🚀 Automatically splits large tasks for parallel execution
- 💬 Each sub-agent's progress displayed in real-time via Discord threads
- 🔄 Results automatically aggregated and returned to Discord

Toggle on/off with the `/team` command.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

> **🛡️ Safety of AntiCrow**

The AntiCrow extension itself **does not contain any malicious or destructive code**. It is designed to prevent exposure of API keys and secret credentials. AntiCrow serves as a bridge that relays instructions from Discord to Antigravity.

> **⚠️ Risks from Antigravity**

However, **Antigravity (the AI coding editor)** that AntiCrow connects to may, based on AI judgment, autonomously perform actions that carry the following risks. **These risks are not caused by AntiCrow, but are inherent to the Antigravity AI platform.**

> **🔧 Technical Architecture**

AntiCrow does not use Antigravity's OAuth keys or API keys. It operates the Antigravity editor directly via **CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol)**. This means there is no risk of being banned for OAuth token misuse. However, if Antigravity updates restrict CDP-based operations, some or all AntiCrow features may stop working.

- **Automated Operation Risks** — AI-driven automation may cause unintended file modifications or deletions
- **Code Modification Risks** — Auto-generated/edited code may break your existing codebase
- **API Key Handling** — Designed to prevent API key exposure, but AI judgment may use keys in unintended ways
- **Self-Responsibility** — All use is entirely at **your own risk**
- **Provided "AS IS"** — Without warranty of any kind, express or implied
- **Developer Disclaimer** — The developer assumes no liability for any damages arising from use
